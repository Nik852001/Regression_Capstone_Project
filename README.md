# Regression_Capstone_Project

Project Summary :
The "Bike Sharing Demand Prediction" project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the demand for bike sharing services in a given location and time frame. Bike sharing systems have become increasingly popular in urban areas, offering an eco-friendly and convenient mode of transportation. Accurate demand prediction is crucial for optimizing bike allocation, ensuring user satisfaction, and managing operational costs effectively.

Key Objectives:

1) Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather historical data on bike rentals, including variables such as date, time, weather conditions, and user information. Clean, preprocess, and transform the data to make it suitable for modeling.

2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to gain insights into the dataset, identifying trends, patterns, and correlations. Visualize the data to better understand the factors influencing bike rental demand.

3) Feature Engineering: Create relevant features, such as time of day, day of the week, and weather indicators, to improve the model's accuracy. Handle categorical variables through encoding techniques.

4) Model Development: Implement various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, to build predictive models. Evaluate and compare the performance of these models using appropriate metrics, like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

5) Model Validation and Testing: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to assess the model's generalization performance. Validate the model's predictions against real-world demand data
